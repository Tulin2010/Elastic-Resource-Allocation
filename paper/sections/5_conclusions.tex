\section{Conclusions and Future work}\label{sec:conclusion-and-future-work}
In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using resource-elastic tasks in edge cloud computing. This ability improves social welfare by 20\% compared to prior work, allowing an expanded use of edge cloud computing when resources are highly limited compared to traditional cloud computing. To do this, we proposed three mechanisms; a greedy approximation algorithm, a centralised incentive compatible auction and a novel decentralised iterative auction. For each algorithm we presented extensive analyses that compare results to the optimal solutions. We also investigated the heuristics of the decentralised iterative auction, the ability to misreport task attributes and the impact of server resource capacity on resource allocation. We have modelled the optimisation problem as a static one-shot case where all of the tasks arrive at the first time step. As part of our future work, we plan to consider a fully online elastic resource allocation optimisation problem.
