    Edge cloud computing enables computational tasks to be processed at the edge of the network, close to the user, where servers have limited resources. Because of this limitation, resource allocation and management is significantly more important than in traditional cloud approaches, as users can cause bottlenecks by over-requesting resources. To address this, we propose a novel approach that takes advantage of the elastic nature of task requirements. In particular, computation and bandwidth resource allocation can be varied flexibly for a particular task to speed it up or slow it down. As this approach has not been considered in prior research, we first propose a scalable approximation algorithm. However, as this algorithm assumes truthful revelation of task constraints and values, we also propose two auction-based approaches. One is a centralised incentive compatible auction, while the other is a novel decentralised iterative auction that does not require users to reveal their private task values. Using extensive simulations, we show that considering the elasticity of resources leads to a gain in social welfare of around 20\% compared to existing approaches, with our proposed auctions achieving around 95\% of the theoretical optimal.
