\section{Empirical Evaluation}\label{sec:empirical-evaluation}
To test the algorithms presented in section~\ref{sec:flexible-resource-allocation-mechanisms}, synthetic models have
been used to generate a list of tasks and servers. These models have been handcrafted with each attribute being
generated from a Gaussian distribution with a mean and standard deviation.

To compare the greedy algorithm to the optimal elastic allocation, a branch and bound was implemented to solve the
optimisation problem in section~\ref{subsec:optimisation-problem}. In order to compare to fixed speed equivalent models,
the minimum total resource required to run the job is found and set as the resource speeds for all of the tasks, with
the optimal solution for running the job with the fixed speeds is found as well. To implement the greedy mechanism, the
value density function was $\frac{v_j}{s_j + w_j + r_j}$, server selection was
$\text{argmin}_{\forall i \in I} S^{'}_i + W^{'}_i + R^{'}_i$ and the resource allocation was
$\text{min} s^{'}_j + w^{'}_j + r^{'}_j$ for job $j$ and servers $I$.

\end{figure}
As figure~\ref{fig:greedy_mechanism_comparison} shows, the greedy mechanism achieves 98\% of the optimal solution for
the small models, the mechanism achieves within 95\% for larger models. In comparison, the fixed allocation achieves
80\% of the optimal solution and always does worse than the social welfare of the greedy mechanism.

Figure~\ref{fig:auction_mechanisms_comparison} compares the social welfare of the auction mechanisms: VCG auction,
fixed resource speed VCG auction, critical value auction and the decentralised iterative auction with different price
change variables.

% Round number

\end{figure}
Within the context of edge cloud computing, the number of rounds for the decentralised iterative auction is important
to making it a feasible auction as it is proportional to the time required to run. We investigated the effect of two
heuristic on the number of rounds and social welfare of the auction; the price change variable and initial cost
heuristic. With an auction using as minimum heuristic values for the price change and initial cost,
figure~\ref{fig:iterative_round_number}, on average 400 rounds were required for the price to converge while an auction
using a price change of 10 and initial cost of 20 means that only on average 80 rounds are required, 5x less. But by
using high initial cost and price change heuristics, this can prevent tasks from being allocated,
figure~\ref{fig:iterative_social_welfare}, shows that the difference in social welfare is only 2\% from minimum to
maximum heuristics.

%As the decentralised iterative auction presented in section \ref{subsec:decentralised-iterative-auction} is not
%incentive compatible, it is possible that misreporting of task attribute can decrease the price paid by a task.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}
In this paper, we studied a resource allocation problem in edge clouds, where resources are elastic and can be
allocated to tasks at varying speeds to satisfy heterogeneous requirements and deadlines. To solve the problem,
we proposed a centralized greedy mechanism with a guaranteed performance bound, and a number of auction-based
mechanisms that also consider the elasticity of resources and limit the potential for strategic manipulation. We show
that explicitly taking advantage of resource elasticity leads to significantly better performance than current
approaches that assume fixed resources.

In future work, we plan to consider the dynamic scenario where tasks arrive and depart from the system over time, and
to also consider the case where task preemption is allowed.
