\section{Conclusion and Future work}\label{sec:conclusion-and-future-work}
In this paper, we studied a resource allocation problem in edge clouds, where resources are elastic and can be
allocated to tasks at varying speeds to satisfy heterogeneous requirements and deadlines. To solve the problem,
we proposed a centralized greedy mechanism with a guaranteed performance bound, and a number of auction-based
mechanisms that also consider the elasticity of resources and limit the potential for strategic manipulation. We show
that explicitly taking advantage of resource elasticity leads to significantly better performance than current
approaches that assume fixed resources.

In future work, while this research considers online based mechanisms
(Subsection~\ref{subsec:comparison-between-online-and-batched-resource-allocation}), this was not the primary
environment these mechanisms were intended to occur within. Therefore additional research will focus primarily on this
online scenario.
