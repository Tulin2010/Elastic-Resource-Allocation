Within Fog Computing, a range of approaches have been proposed for resource management including:
application placement, resource scheduling, task offloading, load balancing, resource allocation,
and resource provisioning~\cite{ghobaei2019resource}. As this work bridges a range of these topics, an outline of
related works from several approaches are explained.

Auctions are a popular method for dealing with self-interested users to limit their ability to gain utility due to misreporting
information. This is also a helpful method of determining the value when allocating multiple limited
resources. Edge-MAP~\cite{tasiopoulos2018edge} provides a client-to-cloud model for tasks with short deadlines
(10-50ms). Through using a Vickrey-English-Dutch (VED) auction, the system arrives at the unique minimum competitive
equilibrium price. Using this, the system is highly scalable and adaptable to dynamically changing network topologies
with cloudlet nodes at the edge of the network. \\
An alternative market-based framework by~\cite{8373684} allows for resources to be efficiently allocated by edge nodes that
are geographically distributed. To maximise the use of node resource, the framework finds the market
equilibrium through optimally allocating resources bundles to a service given each task's budget. This market
equilibrium is found using the Eisenberg-Gale convex program to allow services to maximise their revenue, while a novel
convex optimisation problem is proved to achieve market equilibrium when services maximise their net profit
(revenue minus cost). \\
Within auctions in cloud computing there is a large corpus of research,~\cite{KUMAR2017234} provides a systematic study
of double auction mechanisms that are suitable for a range of distributed systems like Grid computing, Cloud computing,
Inter-Cloud systems. The work reviewed 21 different proposed auction mechanisms over a range of important auction
properties like Economic Efficiency, Incentive Compatibility, and Budget-Balance. In a majority of the proposed auction
mechanisms, truthfulness was only considered for the user, thus a Truthful Multi-Unit Double auction mechanism was
presented as such that both users and servers should act truthfully.

An advantage of fog nodes is that due to the proximity, nodes can find other nodes in its vicinity to assist in a task.
Using this ability,~\cite{8839780} has propose a resource allocation mechanism to allow fog nodes to offload multiple
tasks with delay guarantees. This is helpful due to the limited resources of nodes, thus the system allows for
both other fog nodes or remote cloud centers for further computational resources. This causes an issue to decide where
to offload and how much partial task data to be offloaded under delay guarantee. By formulating the problem as a
Quadratically Constraint Quadratic Programming allows for a solution to be found.

Quality of service is an alternative metric for measuring the success of a system compared to social welfare used in a
majority of mechanisms.~\cite{8379445} propose a resource-efficient computation offloading mechanism for users, where
communication and computation are joined by the node operation when allocating resources. Using a task graph model, the
resource demands of a task are calculated, which are used to compute the optimal communication and computation resource
demand profile for a user in order to minimise a tasks resource occupancy. As the problem is a NP-Hard problem, through an
efficient approximation algorithm, a truthful pricing scheme is used to calculate the critical value for the task to
prevent users from misreporting task valuation.

As Fog Computing often requiring the placement of fog nodes within the system for both localised fog networks and
geographically distance systems due to the short deadline constraints of tasks. Work by~\cite{vaji_infocom}, considers
the placement of code/data needed to run specific tasks over time where the demands change over time while also
considering the operational costs and system stability. Using a proposed approximation algorithm, they achieved 90\% of
the optimal social welfare by converting the problem to a set function optimisation problem. By doing this allows the
algorithm to run in polynomial time complexity. \\
Alternative work by~\cite{Bi2019} to efficiently distribute data centers and connections aims to maximise social
welfare instead of the number of tasks completed. A truthful online mechanism was proposed that was incentive compatible
and individually rational, to allow tasks to arrive over time by solving an integer programming optimisation problem.

All of the approaches explained above for task pricing and resource allocation in Cloud Computing use a form of fixed
resource allocation, where each user requests a fixed amount of resources for a task from a server. This is often as a
VM of different specifications. However, this mechanism, as previously explained, provides no control for the server
over the amount of resources allocated to a task, only allowing the server to determine a task's price.

Our problem is related to multidimensional knapsack problems where there is a large body of
works~\cite{knapsacks, numbers}. In particular~\cite{Nip2017}, considers the flexibility of item weights with a linear
constraint that must be fulfilled for the item to be allocated. The paper provides a pseudo-polynomial time complexity
algorithm for solving this problem to maximize the values in the knapsack. Our optimisation problem case is similar to
their, but differs due to constraints with our using non-linear not linear constraints.
