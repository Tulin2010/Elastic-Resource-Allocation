\section{Related work}\label{sec:related-work}
There is a considerable amount of research in the area of resource allocation and pricing in cloud computing, some of
which use auction mechanisms to deal with competition~\cite{KUMAR2017234,Zhang2017,Du2019,Bi2019}.
However, these approaches assume that users request a fixed amount of resources system resources and processing rates,
with the cloud provider having no control over the speeds, only the servers that the task was allocated to. In our
work, tasks' owners report deadlines and overall data and computation requirements, allowing the edge cloud server to
distribute its resources more efficiently based on each task's requirements.

Other closely related work on resource allocation in edge clouds~\cite{vaji_infocom} considers both the placement of
code/data needed to run a specific task, as well as the scheduling of tasks to different edge clouds. The goal there is
to maximize the expected rate of successfully accomplished tasks over time. Our work is different both in the setup and
the objective function. Our objective is to maximize the value over all tasks. In terms of the setup, they assume that
data/code can be shared and they do not consider the elasticity of resources.

Our problem is related to multidimensional knapsack problems. In particular~\cite{Nip2017}, consider flexibility in
the allocation, with linear constraints that are used for elastic weights. The paper provides a pseudo-polynomial time
complexity algorithm for solving this problem to maximize the values in the knapsack. Our optimisation problem case is
similar to their, but differ due to constraints with our using non-linear not linear constraints.
