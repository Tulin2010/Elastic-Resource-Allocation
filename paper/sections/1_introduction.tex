\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
In the last few years, cloud computing~\cite{cloud_cite} has become a popular solution for running data-intensive
applications remotely. However, large scale data-centres are not a feasible in application domains that require low
latency or high security and privacy. To deal with such domains, \emph{fog/edge computing} has emerged as a
complementary paradigm allowing tasks to be executed at the edge of networks, close to the user, in small data-centers,
known as \emph{edge clouds}.

As the Internet-of-things grows, fog/edge cloud computing is a key enabling technology in particular for applications
in smart cities, disaster response scenarios, home automation systems, etc. In these applications, low-powered devices
generate data or tasks that can't be processed locally but are impractical to use with standard cloud computing
services. More specifically, in smart cities, these devices could be smart traffic light systems that collect data from
roadside sensors to optimise the traffic light sequence to minimise vehicle waiting times; or to analyse videos feeds
from CCTV cameras of suspicious behaviour. In disaster response, sensor data from autonomous vehicles can be aggregated
to produce real-time maps of devastated areas to help first responders better understand the situation and search for
survivors.

To accomplish these tasks, there are typically several types of resources that are needed, including communication
bandwidth, computational power and data storage resources~\cite{vaji_infocom}, and tasks are generally
delay-sensitive, i.e., have a specific completion deadline. When accomplished, different tasks carry different values
for their owners (e.g., the users of IoT devices or other stakeholders such as the police or traffic authority). This
value will depend on the importance of the task, e.g., analysing current levels of air pollution may be less important
than preventing a large-scale traffic jam at peak times or tracking a criminal on the run. Given that edge clouds are
often highly constrained in their resources~\cite{edge_limitations}, we are interested in allocating tasks to edge
cloud servers to maximize the overall social welfare achieved (i.e., the sum of completed task values). This is
particularly challenging, because users in edge clouds are typically self-interested and may behave
strategically~\cite{Bi2019} or may prefer not to reveal private information about their values to a central allocation
mechanism~\cite{Pai2013}.

An important shortcoming of existing work of resource allocation in edge cloud computing is that it assumes tasks have
strict resource requirements -- that is, each task must be allocate a fixed amount of CPU cycles or bandwidth by a
server. This can cause bottlenecks for certain resources when multiple tasks over-request resources. However, in
practice tasks have flexibility in how resources are allocated given the task is computed within a time limit. This
ability to flexibility allocate resource is additionally important in the case of edge computing due to the limited
resource capacities that servers have in comparison to large data-centre. Using this idea of task resource flexibility,
in this paper, we proposed a new optimisation problem that is incompatible with previous research. Therefore three
mechanisms are proposed for the problem: a greedy mechanism, an incentive compatible centralised auction and a novel
decentralised iterative auction that achieve ~95\% of the theoretical optimal.
