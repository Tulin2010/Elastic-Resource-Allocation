\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}
In prior research into resource pricing for cloud based resource allocation, the jobs considered have had
fixed resource requirements that could then be requested from a cloud provider. However this could result in
different job's fighting over a single resource instead of sharing the resource fairly due to the lack of knowledge of each other.
In this research we consider jobs that have requirements that are constrainted by a deadline allowing the
cloud services the ability to dynamically allocate resources depended how the usage of it's resources by other jobs
and allowing resources to be shared more effectively. We have also developed a greedy algorithm to that finds near-optimals
of problem cases to maximise the social welfare where there it total knowledge. However in real life, two problems arise of
servers wished to be fairly payed for the work it does and jobs may be want to reveals their job utility.
To solve these problems we have created an iterative auctions that we compare to VCG auctions.
