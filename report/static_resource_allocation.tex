\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}
In prior research into resource pricing for resource allocation within cloud computing, job's considered have had
fixed resource requirements that job's owner would then request from a cloud service. However this could result in
different job's fighting over a single resource instead of sharing the resource fairly.
In this research we consider job's that have requirements that must be fulfill with a deadline allowing the
cloud services the ability to dynamically allocate resources depended how the usage of it's resources from other jobs
and share resources more effectively. We have then developed a greedy algorithm to solve the problem to maximise the
social welfare where the utility is known of each jobs. However in real life, server's that run a job would want
to be payed to run a job so we have developed an iterative auction. \\
