\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}
In prior research into resource pricing for resource allocation within cloud computing, job's considered have had fixed resource requirements that server's must fulfill.
However in this research we consider job's that have requirements that must be fulfill with a deadline so that the resource allocation must allow the deadline consider to be true.
We have then developed a greedy algorithm to solve the problem to maximise the social welfare where the total utility is known of each jobs.
However in real life then server's that run the job would want to be payed to run a job so we have developed new auction. \\
In the new section, we will describe the problem case and how we generated a model. \\
